- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lo4e-somnus

I'm looking for open-source projects to contribute to and people to collaborate with! I love creating and tinkering with small, static websites using frameworks like Jekyll or Hugo. I'm a big proponent of putting an emphasis on accessibility and the [A11y project](https://www.a11yproject.com/) in web development.
